# _Simple Toon_ Shader Blender Recreation
This is a blender recreation of the _"Universal Render Pipeline/Simple Toon"_ shader presumably created for Puyo Puyo Puzzle Pop

## Accidental Addition
I did edit some of the values in the shader values to get some nicer results, but the original values are still kept there (for arle)
Also I went ahead and added in Blinn-Phong based specular when (after I finished) turns out they left the values from when the shader had it implemented! since the final code literally doesnt reference the variables they created.
![1 occurance of "_Shininess" variable, the declaration](https://github.com/KnolaWT/PPPPSimpleToonBlenderShader/assets/74639561/edf37a3b-253b-4fc7-85e4-bcfab4e15c5b)
Additionally there is seemingly another accidental unused **much simpler** version of the shader which from what I can tell at _"Pine/Effect/Effect_ToonBase"_ I added the disassembly since I accidentally started building off of that before restarting

## Model Files
Thanks to **Tiniest Turtles** we have easily imported fbx files of all of the playable characters (at release)
